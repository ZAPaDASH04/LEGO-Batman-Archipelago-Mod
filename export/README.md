This is instructions for the beta test of Lego Batman: The Videogame for Archipelago multiworld randomizer. \
\
This beta test is essentially an episode 1 kits only test. A kit hunt if you will. When you run the program it will run some setup for the sake of testing such as unlocking all levels and characters to make the hunt faster. \
** Important Notes
- You must use unmodified steam version of LEGO Batman: The Videogame
- Is not compatible with reconnecting. You will have to restart the game, load the save then ONLY once you have control of the characters, run the LB1I.exe again.
- Make sure to pay attention to the hint text to see if it skips anything. (check that kits aren't being missed)

** Instructions
- Set up an AP game (Beta test is not intended for multiple players or serious games. You can play multiple games if you wish.)
- place all files in this folder into the folder of the exe for Lego Batman 1. (LB1I.exe should end up in the same folder as LEGOBatman.exe)
- open the APConnect.txt file and add the AP info. follow instructions on the first line.
- run lego batman (tested methods: through steam. directly through the exe. using DXWND).
- make a new game AND EXIT THE LEVEL.
- once in the hub run the LB1I.exe
- check that a message appeared in the hint box indicating that the program connected.
- check the AP game webpage to see that you have connected.
- Get those kits!
