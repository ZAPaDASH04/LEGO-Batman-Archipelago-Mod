This is instructions for the beta test of Lego Batman: The Videogame for Archipelago multiworld randomizer. 

This beta test is essentially an episode 1 kits only test. A kit hunt if you will. When you run the program it will run some setup for the sake of testing such as unlocking all levels and characters to make the hunt faster.
** Important Notes
- You must use unmodified steam version of LEGO Batman: The Videogame
- You be using a 3rd party tool, a mod loader called Reloaded II, to run
- It is not compatible with reconnecting. You will have to restart the game, load the save then ONLY once you have control of the characters, run the LB1I.exe again.
- Make sure to pay attention to the hint text to see if it skips anything. (check that kits aren't being missed)
- debug messages are logged in a.txt (ours) and b.txt (ap's)
