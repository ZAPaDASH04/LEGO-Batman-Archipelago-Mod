This is instructions for the beta test of Lego Batman: The Videogame for Archipelago multiworld randomizer made by ZAPaDASH04 and Jr (jr5768).
With assistance from:
- Snolid Ice
- Spencenox

This beta test is essentially an episode 1 kits only test. A kit hunt if you will. When you run the program it will run some setup for the sake of testing such as unlocking all levels, characters, suits, and red bricks to make the hunt faster.
## Important Notes
- You must use unmodified steam version of LEGO Batman: The Videogame
- You will be using a 3rd party tool, a mod loader called Reloaded II, to run. Installation instructions are included in the instructions below.
- Make sure to pay attention to the hint text to see if it skips anything. (check that kits aren't being missed)
- debug messages are logged in a.txt (ours) and b.txt (ap's) both of which will be located in the LEGOBatman.exe folder.

### Instructions

#### Onetime Setup

- Install [Reloaded II](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/QuickStart "This is where I got it.")
- Add lego batman either through setup or by clicking the + on the left. Must use the exe found in the legobatman folder of steam (LEGOBatman.exe).
- If you don't already have the mod "Reloaded II Server", click the Download Mods button in the top left and search for "Reloaded II Server" made by Sewer56 and download it.
- Navigate to the "Mods" folder in wherever you installed Reloaded II (usually desktop .\Reloaded-II\Mods)
- Move the 2 folders "legobatman1.apconnectsupport" and "legobatman1.apsupport" into the Reloaded II Mods folder.

- Once in the hub go to Reloaded II and click lego batman on the left side.
- In "Configure Mods" enable only "Reloaded II Server" and "LB1 Archipelago". (they should have a red plus while disabled mods if any have a grey minus) LB1 Client Connector should be a filled red box.
